Constant buzzing 

Two story mead hall

"Time of mourning"

Our beloved speaker has been killed

Memorial due at local shrine

Shrine of the Flaming Sword
God Tempus, of war

Angry words with female goliath
Small magic aura
Accusations of theft
Bought mead

Kwan 
Skytower Shelter
Looking for [[Oyaminartok]] goliath werebear
