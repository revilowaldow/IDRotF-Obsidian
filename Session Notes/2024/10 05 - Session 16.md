Took [[Durth]] back to [[captain aligarth]]  (aloe vera)

[[Xardorok Sunblight]]

Durth is the lesser son

[[Nildarr]] is the preffered son of Xaradorok

[[Xardorok]] has gone rogue, building something, needs a lot of chardylin

He has a great forge, powered by the heart of a red dragon

[[Rinaldo]] did the seance, the white lady

Durth's letter to Xardorok

Father,

The frost druids are relentless in their commitment to Auril and their pursuit of misery to the towns folk. I almost admire them but they seem to think they have command over me, this makes me hate them almost as much as those arrogant surface dwelling dwarves that hide in the valley. Despite this, the druids are undeniably helping our cause, giving us vital information in our search for Chardalyn fragments. We have found a large chardalyn artefact but it is guarded within the walls of the Easthaven Town Hall. Retrieving it will almost certainly mean we are discovered and killed. I do not understand your alliance with the Frostmaiden and these druids, but I will retrieve it for you to prove my worth to you father.

Durth

Sent Rendaril the lantern of tracking, ideally to be used to track duergar, but could be a source
