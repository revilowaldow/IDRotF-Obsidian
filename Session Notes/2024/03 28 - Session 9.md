[[Iriskri]] - shopkeep who delivered basket to frost druids, stabbed vurnis in the back

[[Hameylyn]] feeds the awakened shrub some axe beak dung

[[Meakas Anranrakas]] - Skilful individual, known from a past life

Torinn touched by the frostmaiden?
	Mother was sacrificed to Auril
	Ever since I was little shrugged off the cold
	Adopted parents discovered him on a midwinter holiday
	Want to go back to Easthaven left abruptly
	Spent a lot of time working behind the bar [[Wet Trout]]

Nasir dream
In bed with lady
fishbowl with angler fish in on desk

Tando dream
On ship, blizzard, crash
Very cold, blizzard shapes of town

Torinn dream
Battle fending off sword attacks
Compatriots aside
Blow to head
In wet trout, mum not there
very sad

Hamlyn
dream of dinner table in cabin, whole table of food
Eat and eat and eat
Look up and massive toad opposite

Cloud
dream myself wandering ten towns feeling isolated
taking solace in views in wilderness, despite hate it, still beautiful
Taking accurate notes and maps


Morning:

Animated stood collecting wood?

Red Tiefling with green eyes and long black silky hair and wings

Dressed in expensive bright clothes

Paint and charcoal

[[Meakas Anranrakas]]
Animated spectral hand doing sketching

Shield of all the towns on the wall

White Moose up antlers and pelt
