Miner is missing presumed dead and this happened prior to the kobold's arrival

Found a magical(?) pink gem inside a fossilised skull.

Killed a grell in the mine

Tied up the kobolds inc. Trex

Returning to [[Oarus Masthew]] 

Need to do mining in the mine before reopening it

Spoke to Marta, dad doing better?

Tando and Hamelyn go to find Oarus

Town hall has a genie with gemstones for eyes and teeth carved on the outside

Trex's bag is filled with moss from Kelvin's Cairn
