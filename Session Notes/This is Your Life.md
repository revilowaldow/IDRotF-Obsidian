You know who your parents are or were

Born in a cave

Not originally a leopard

3 siblings
- Younger x1
- Older x2

Family of dwarves

Raised by single father

Mother killed by crashing spaceship

Father tells tales of ship

I go to look for ship

I succumb to cold

Druid revives me through a ritual and I take on characteristics of sacrificial snow leopard

Modest lifestyle

One of the ten towns as place growing up

I had several friends and my childhood was generally happy

My anger needed to be channelled into battle, or I risked becoming an indiscriminate killer
