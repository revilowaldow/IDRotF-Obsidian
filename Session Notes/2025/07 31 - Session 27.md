[[Nasir]] wrote a poem

Remembrance for Ten-Towns:
> They lived where winter knows no end,
> In hearth and hall, in foe and friend.
> When shadow fell from dragon's wing,
> They rose as one, unwavering.
> Though flames consumed the homes they knew,
> Their strength and love still carried through.
> No fire can dim the lives they gave—
> Their light lives on beyond the grave.
> So light a flame, and let it burn—
> For hearts that never shall return.
> As in the wind, and drifting snow,
> The spirit of Ten-Towns will always glow.
