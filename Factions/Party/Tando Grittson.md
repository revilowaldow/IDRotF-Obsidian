> My friends.. and I do mean that now. Conflict has a way of binding people and we have see our fair share of that in these last months together.
> I believe to achieve my goals I must re-learn to trust. And in doing that, I shall tell you my story.
> I hail from the Grittson line, and as you know, I have been looking in our adventures (and as a matter of fact for a number of years prior to our introduction) to find a way back to my home, The Lithos Pantheon. I had previously mentioned that my father was accidently transported to this world many years ago where he became trapped, settled down and formed a life. This is not true.
> I hope you can forgive my abrasiveness until now, but there are many out there in the shadows who wish to kill me even now. You see it was not that my father was exiled, but he was usurped. Where I come from, we have great pillars of gleaming precious crystals, far superior to those found on earth. It became apparent to some greedy earthen prospectors that our kingdom - MY kingdom - could be treated like a mine, like some dirty hole in the ground.
> Yes, thatâ€™s right, you see, my father was usurped and I am not just from the earthen realm, but I am the heir to the Lithos Pantheon, the largest and most expansive kingdom in the realm. Our family line ruled with prosperity, dignity and democracy. Our people lauded us and celebrated the way we improved life, until one day, a traveller came to visit. He claimed he was a navigator with magical powers, able to open portals to new realms for exploration and the sharing of knowledge. We welcomed this traveller with open arms, until he took his leave, only to return with an army of workers, miners and slaves from the earthen plane.
> With no quarrels we had no need for armies or militias, so they slaughtered our people, and harvested our homes. They took handfuls, then bagfuls then cartloads through magical gates, taking pieces of our land back to the earthern realm to be adorned onto garments, to be bartered with and lusted over. Greed, envy and power meant people were happy to pillage and slaughter our kingdom of peace for their own gain.
> We fought back as we could, but as heir to the kingdom I was captured and thrown through a rift as they were transporting back a horde of precious stones.
> I awoke and have spent several years now gathering information on these people and to find a way back to my home. I was in Luskan when I first heard of the Arcane Brotherhood, people who seemed like they had knowledge - a currency I value far greater than material objects - who could help me. I travelled with Nass Lantomer, who promised me she was heading out on an expedition which would yield great arcane knowledge, and with that power she may even be able to restore a portal to my home. The rest you know.
> Forgive me in my appearance and demeanour, for I have not always been this way. For when I lived in Lithos, I was a happy, friendly person. I am merely a shadow of that now, carved by the horrors I have seen. You see, still under great threat of capture or death in the earthern realm as a genasi, I was forced to keep to the shadows, honing my ability to stay out of sight and watch my back. As time went on, I gained skills in how to look after myself, and building resentment lead me down a path I never wanted to take.
> You see every day I have dreamt of taking back my kingdom, for my people. It is being held hostage, and the way to do that is to rid the land of these parasite invaders. I learnt how to be deadly in the shadows, becoming a ghost and a shadow. I have learnt how to become a competent assassin, ready for my return to Lithos. However, having spent time with you companions recently, I have learnt it is not enough to get revenge, I must learn how to lead. Helping to rebuild the ten-towns, or protecting you all from Dragons has shown me there is much more to being a leader than deadly force and power. One needs to be smart, to plan, and most of all to trust.
> So this is why I open myself up to you all now, at great personal peril, to thank you, and to ask for your help on my journey to restore my kingdom in the earthen realms.
