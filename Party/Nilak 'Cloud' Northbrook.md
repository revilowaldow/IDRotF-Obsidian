## Backstory: 

Nilak is the younger middle child of [[Olwen Northbrook]] and [[Isolde Northbrook]]. A family of dwarves, Olwen and Isolde moved to [[Town 1]] with their eldest child [[Boreas Northbrook|Boreas]] when he was just 35. In the following years they had a further three children; [[Talvi Northbrook|Talvi]], Nilak and [[Andri Northbrook|Andri]]; who were born 11, 30 and 37 years later respectively.

Olwen was employed as a guard, while Isolde worked in the weaver's guild. Boreas was an entertainer before his injury. While a jeweller took a shine to the young girl Talvi who would peep through the window whenever she was in [[Town 2]]. Talvi ultimately took over the shop after the former proprietor passed and is now a renowned jeweller in [[Town 2]]. Nilak was originally planning to follow his father into the guard and fought frequently with his younger brother Andri, a hothead with something to prove. 

Everything changed for the family when the ~~fire nation attacked~~ eternal winter started. Just a few months into the freeze Nilak's mother Isolde disappeared on a trip between towns taking woven goods to keep people warm. Olwen swore blind that he had seen a metal vessel screaming across the sky to the ground around the same time. He was heartbroken when she did not return and kept raving about the ship. His fanatic obsession resulted in his dismissal from the guard. Now unable to support his injured son Boreas, and with Talvi in another town he was forced to rely upon Nilak. Andri and Nilak's fights became more frequent and severe, what was once boisterous sibling rivalry became a deeper resentment.  

After many nights consoling his pleading, broken father Nilak resolved to search for any evidence of his mother's demise, a nigh impossible task in the constant blizzards and darkness. Nilak stormed out in the wilderness slamming the door shut in the face of Andri's latest tirade telling him to give up on Isolde. Nilak was unsuccessful in his search, but worse than that, he completely lost his way. Feeling the cold close in, and his vision dim Nilak considered how he had failed his family. 

'Cloud' awoke on his back in the middle of a ritualistic henge, stones inscribed with primal symbols in dried blood, and the corpse of a slaughtered leopard nearby. Cloud could remember everything up to the moment he succumbed to the cold. With nothing else he could do he tried to return home while coming to terms with his new form and the burning rage he felt within himself, anger at everything; His mother's death, his father's dismissal, his own failure, his new form, the cold, his damaged relationship with his brother. 

Returning to [[Town 1]] Nilak crept into his old home and struggled to explain what had happened to him. His brothers were not accepting, telling him he had throw away their only source of income (his own job) for nothing. His father was silent, knowing he had tried to do this for him, but also knowing that he could not stay with them, the townsfolk would not accept him. Sadly telling him to stay away but that he loved him.

Cloud had a new source of anger, his own family's rejection of him. On the way out of town he swiped a bottle of mead and drunk to forget,
